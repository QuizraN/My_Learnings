1. Is array passed by value or reference to a function. Justify your answer with an example.

Array is passed by reference to a function
Considering the code:
let a=[1,2,3]
function f1(x)
{
x[1]=6;
return x;
}
console.log(f1(a));

OUTPUT:[1,6,3]

Since the array is passed by reference the value is changed outside the scope of the function as well.



2. Write a Javascript function to clone an array without using loops.
Three different ways:

let a=[1,2,3,4,5]
console.log(a.slice())
console.log(Array.from(a))
console.log([...a])



3. Breifly explain the below Array methods with examples
shift, unshit, slice, splice, pop

ex: a=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Shift:
It is used to remove first item of an array
Changes original array
returns shifted element
functionality is similar to pop() from the start.
a.shift()//[2,3,4,5,6,7]

Unshift:
it adds an item to the beginning of an array shifting every other item to next index
it modies original array 
similar to push() but from the start
returns length of the new array
a.ushift(10)//[10,2,3,4,5,6,7]
a.ushift(10)//[10,10,2,3,4,5,6,7]

Slice:
it is used to get slice of an array.
console.log(a.slice(1,3)) //1 is inclusive and 3 is exclusive

OUTPUT:[2,3]

Splice:
it can 1.add
	2.remove
	elements of an array
returns removed array
Syntax:a.splice(start_index,no_of_elements_to_remove,x,y,z)//here x,y,z are added at the position of start_index
a.splice(2,3,99,987)
OUTPUT: 
(6) [1, 2, 99, 987, 6, 7]
