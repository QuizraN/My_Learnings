1. Using a for loop output the elements in reverse order [1,2,3,4,5]
a=[1,2,3,4,5]
for (let counter = a.length-1; counter >=0; counter--){
  console.log(a[counter]);
}


2. Whats the difference between for .. of and for .. in
Sample program:

a=[9,8,7,6,5]
for(let i in a) //output is the indexes(KEY)
{console.log(i);}
for(let i of a)
{console.log(i);}//output is the value at index(VALUE)

OUTPUT:
0
1
2
3
4
9
8
7
6
5
